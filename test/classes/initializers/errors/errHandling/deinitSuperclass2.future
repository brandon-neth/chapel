feature request: Permit superclass 'init's to 'throw' after their 'init this;'

This test was designed to ensure that a throwing superclass 'init()'
after 'init this;' would cause the superclass fields to be cleaned up,
but not the subclass fields.  However, at present, we don't permit
calls to 'super.init()' that throw.  I expect this would not be hard
to enable, but that's work for another day.
