# The main purpose of this test is to make sure it doesn't core dump, but
# here we also check that the right information is being printed at all.

# Note, this prediff is intended to avoid noise in the case that the
# output is interleaved, which sometimes happens in testing.
# It does that by using grep with --max-count to check that
# key patterns occur 3 or more times (we expect 10, so that
# leaves some room for interleaving).
