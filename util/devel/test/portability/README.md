# Chapel portability tests

This directory contains configurations to run basic Chapel portability tests
on various OSes.

## Tools used

Apptainer is lighter weight and preferred going forward, and Vagrant is used
for platforms that we can't run with Apptainer or haven't ported over yet.

## More info

See the specific README files in the Apptainer and Vagrant subdirectories for
more information.
