     This function is intended to be called from within a GPU
     kernel and is useful for debugging purposes.

     Currently writeln() will make a loop ineligable for
     gpuization. This function is here as a stopgap measure
     until we fix that.

     Currently this function will only work if values of type
     c_string are passed.

     On NVIDIA GPUs the written values will be flushed to the
     terminal after the kernel has finished executing.
     Note that there is (by default) a 1MB limit on the size
     of this buffer.

    // to look like this:
    //
    //    chpl_gpu_write((args[i] : string).c_str());

    // Unfortunately that made things un-gpuizable as I believe
    // it ends up calling the constructor for string which
    // somewhere uses the the "outside variable" "nil", which
    // fails our gpuization check.
    //
    // I also explored making `printf` an extern proc
    // and calling it directly but that resulted in this error:
    //   ptxas fatal   : Unresolved extern function 'printf
