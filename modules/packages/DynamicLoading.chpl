Support for dynamic loading in Chapel.

.. note::

  To ``use`` this module, the experimental procedure pointer feature
  must be activated. Do this by setting the ``config param`` named
  ``useProcedurePointers`` to ``true``.

This module provides the ability to load a binary at runtime. Procedures
contained in a dynamically loaded binary can be retrieved and called on
any locale without compile-time knowledge of their names or locations.

A hypothetical C binary could contain a procedure named ``foo``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/packages/DynamicLoading/doc-examples/TestBinary.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

This binary can be can be loaded in Chapel at runtime as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/packages/DynamicLoading/doc-examples/ModuleDocTest.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE_0
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE_0

And a procedure named ``foo`` with type ``proc(): void`` can be retrieved:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/packages/DynamicLoading/doc-examples/ModuleDocTest.chpl
   :language: chapel
   :start-after: START_EXAMPLE_1
   :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE_1

When a procedure is retrieved from a loaded binary, the returned procedure
value is callable on any locale despite :proc:`binary.retrieve()` only
being called on a single locale. The returned procedure is considered to
be ``extern`` and this is reflected in its type.

.. note::

  Currently, only procedures can be retrieved from loaded binaries.
  Support for retrieving references to data stored in a binary could
  be added in the future.

    that stores the path to a binary file. The file may be any executable
    binary, though a "shared library" or "dynamic library" is by far the

    The implementation will attempt to load a binary on all locales. If
    loading should fail on any locale then the entire process will be
    aborted and an error will be thrown.

    Dynamic loading can fail for a variety of reasons. It can fail if the
    binary could not be loaded on any locale. It can fail if no file was
    found at ``path`` or if a file was found but it did not have a suitable
    representation (e.g., the file format was not natively executable, or
    it was not marked as executable).

    .. warning::

      The procedure type ``t`` provided when calling :proc:`binary.retrieve()`
      is used verbatim and is not checked against the type of the underlying
      symbol in any way. If the type provided does not match the actual type
      of the underlying procedure, then the resulting behavior when the
      retrieved procedure is called is undefined. Crashes or other bugs
      could occur.

    The retrieved procedure is considered to be ``extern`` and will use an
    extern calling convention, the same as is used for other ``extern``
    procedures declared in Chapel code. This impacts how it can be used.
    For example, it cannot currently be assigned to a procedure value that
    is not also considered ``extern``.
